## Abstraction and automation
### Problem solving

- Proposition = statement which can be either **true** or **false**
- Compound proposition = made up of two simpler propositions
- Major and minor propositions infer and deduct conclusions

e.g
Major proposition: If it is snowing then it is cold
Minor proposition: It is snowing
Conclusion: Therefore, it is cold
