### Problem solving

*Propositon*
- Proposition = statement which can be either **true** or **false**
- Compound proposition = made up of two simpler propositions
- Major and minor propositions infer and deduct conclusions

e.g

Major proposition: If it is snowing then it is cold

Minor proposition: It is snowing

Conclusion: Therefore, it is cold

*Conditional connective* 

If we know that "It is snowing" is true only if "It is cold" is true then using propositional variables, P and Q.

P = "It is snowing" and Q = "It is cold". P => Q reads P is true only if Q is true or P implies Q.

P is called the hypothesis (or antecedent or premise) and Q is called the conclusion (or consequence). So if the conditioal statement is true and the hypothesis is true then the conclusion is true.

Major proposition: If it is snowing then it is cold

Minor proposition: It is snowing

Conclusion: Therefore, it is cold
